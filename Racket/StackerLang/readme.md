This code is following along with the book 'Beautiful Racket - An Introduction to Language-Oriented Programming using Racket' by Matthew Buterick (v1.6) 
This is from the first section of the book creating the language 'Stacker'. 

Changelog (02/15/2022): 
			For the language 'Stacker' - The reader has been set up, and I am needing to implement the expander. 
			Nothing from the exander section has been implemented.
